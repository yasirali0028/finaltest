                <p className="content-paragraph">"Creemees Services may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.

For example, if you personalize Creemees pages, or register with Creemees Services or services, a cookie helps Creemees to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Creemees website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Creemees features that you customized."</p>
                <p className="content-paragraph">"You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Creemees Services."</p>
